This repo contains the code for the compostional simulator developed for the paper ""Compositional simulation for carbon storage in porous media using an electrolyte association equation of state" (submitted to the SPE Journal).

You can find the example scripts in the folder code_for_spej.

Before you run the example scripts, the startup.m file must then be run to activate MRST.

Please refer to MRST website https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst on how to run and explore the examples.
