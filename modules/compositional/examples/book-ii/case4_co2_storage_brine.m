%% Simulation CO2 storage in saline aquifers
% Geological storage of CO2 into saline aquifers consists of two periods
% which include injection and post injection periods. The model developed
% is used to study CO2 dissolution into formation brines during the
% injection period and using an idealized 2D geometry for the aquifer.

% The numerical model consists of 99 grid blocks in horizontal direction
% and 39 grid blocks in vertical direction.The grid blocks in horizontal
% direction are refined around the injection well, with a minimum of one
% meter close to the injection well and a maximum of 99 meters at the outer
% boundary, which is located 5 km away from the injection well. The grid
% blocks in the vertical direction have the same size of one meter.
